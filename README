Photobox
--------


Photobox is a simple Node.js project that aims
to do the following:

    1. Allow users to register.
    2. Authenticate registered users.
    3. Allow authenticated users to upload photos.
    4. Allow authenticated users to arrange photos into public
       and private galleries.


Installation
------------

You need to install the following basic packages first:

    1. node
    2. npm
    3. imagemagick
    4. mongodb

Once you have installed these you can then do the following:

    1. git clone https://github.com/ilmarinen/photobox.git
    2. cd photobox
    3. npm install

npm will install all the necessary modules into photobox/node_modules

You can then start the web application by typing:

    node app.js

By default it listens on port 8000. You can change this by editing
the port setting in app.js. If you want it to listen on port 80 you
will need sudo privileges.
